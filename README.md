# Spar

Spar (`Sotsera.Spar`) is a Windows desktop framework being built from scratch around a C# backend and a framework-neutral web SPA, inspired by Tauri.

The priority is an excellent development experience: SPA HMR, supported C# Hot Reload, coordinated application restarts, and inspection and control for AI agents. VS Code comes first, with Visual Studio support alongside it.

Production targets NativeAOT by default, with CoreCLR compatibility for applications that add AOT-incompatible dependencies. Development uses CoreCLR for debugging and Hot Reload.

## Current status

Implementation has started with an isolated CoreCLR Hot Reload probe and real watcher/editor acceptance tooling. Native windows, the bridge, SPA integration, and NativeAOT delivery are still ahead. See the [probe results and remaining gates](docs/07-managed-probe.md); no full milestone acceptance scenario is complete yet.

## Run the first slice

Install SDK `10.0.402`, selected in `global.json`, then run from this checkout:

```powershell
dotnet build Spar.slnx --disable-build-servers
dotnet test --solution Spar.slnx --no-build
dotnet watch --project experiments/Spar.HotReloadProbe run
```

The tests edit disposable copies under `artifacts/` and launch real `dotnet watch` processes. The [editor probe guide](docs/07-managed-probe.md) covers VS Code automation, F5 setup, and the recorded Visual Studio manual pass. These are development experiments, not shipping Spar packages.
